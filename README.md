Title Detecting Anomalies in Credit Card Transactions using Power BI

Abstract:

In this project, we will explore how to utilize Power BI, a powerful data visualization and business intelligence tool, to detect anomalies in credit card transactions. Anomalies in credit card transactions can indicate fraudulent activity, and by leveraging Power BI's features, we can effectively analyze large datasets and identify suspicious patterns. This project aims to provide a comprehensive guide on leveraging Power BI to detect anomalies, enabling businesses and financial institutions to enhance their fraud detection capabilities.
